    //~ * Map * ~


    //TODO Together: Let's see a common approach we might have done in the past: our goal is to increase each element of an array by 1 [element + 1], then get an array back with those values
    //
    // var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    //
    // var numbersAddOne = [];
    //
    // for (var i = 0; i < numbers.length; i+= 1){
    //     numbersAddOne.push(numbers[i] + 1);
    // }
    //
    // console.log(numbersAddOne);

    //TODO Together: Now, let's achieve the same result with the first part of our lesson: the MAP method~

    // let numbersAddOneMap = numbers.map(function(num){
    //     return num + 1;
    // })
    //
    // console.log(numbersAddOneMap);


    //TODO Together: Let's get all these restaurant names out of this array of objects with .map()!



    // var nameList = favFoods.map(function(resturant){
    //     return resturant.name;
    // })


    //TODO: Create your own array of (up to 3 and at least 2) restaurant objects building off of the basic list you created during the MapBox exercise (or build one anew!) ~5 mins


    var favFoods =
        [{
            name: "The Hayden",
            addr: "4025 Broadway, San Antonio, TX 78209",
            contents: "<a>The Hayden</a>",

        },
            {
                name: "The Filling Station",
                addr: "701 S St Mary's St, San Antonio, TX 78204",
                contents: "<a>The Filling Station</a>",
            },
            {
                name: "Halcyon",
                addr: "1414 S Alamo St, San Antonio, TX 78210",
                contents: "<a>Halcyon</a>",
                features: ["study", "coffee"]
            }]

    //TODO: Now, having created a personal array of restaurant objects for yourself, use .map() to get your favorite restaurant's names out of that collection, into another array, and out into the console! ~5 mins



    //~ * Filter * ~



    //TODO Together: Once again, let's take a look at the old way we might approach an issue: getting only one type of values out of an array (for example: even numbers only from an array of nums!)

    // var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    //
    //



    //TODO Together: Now, let's refactor the above using the ES6 .filter() method with the same goal: even numbers only!

    var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

    let evens = numbers.filter(function(num){
        return num % 2 === 0;
    })

    console.log(evens);


    //TODO Together: Using my favoriteRestaurants list, let's filter out all of the non-buffet restaurants

    // let hasBuffet = favFoods.filter(function(restaurant){
    //     return restaurant.features.includes("features")
    // })
    //
    // console.log(hasBuffet);

    //TODO: Each one of your restaurant arrays is unique, but, in that array, identify something to filter by - it could be as simple as "well, let me filter out all of the restaurants with names shorter


    let nameLessThan8 = favFoods.filter(function(resturant){
        return resturant.name.length < 16;
    })

    console.log(nameLessThan8);

    //TODO: Once you've done the above, go ahead and write the necessary code to achieve what you wanted - remember to practice with .filter() and our ES6 verbiage!



    //~ * Reduce * ~



    //Reduce is an interesting animal in and of itself: it's a way to reduce a collection down to, typically, a single value of some kind:



    //TODO Together: Let's sum up some numbers with the .reduce() method and a number array!

    // let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    //in the past: we would have built out a loop and used a var of sum, and had a look inside of the loop of sum += numbers[i], spit out sum with the sum of our numbers

    //In ES6 with .reduce():

    let sum = numbers.reduce(function(total, num){ return total + num;}, 0);

    console.log("Our numbers added up are " + sum);

    //TODO Together: Let's take a step a bit deeper with .reduce() - .reduce()'s output can take many forms and shapes. For example, let's say we wanted to have a little Javascript that would count the length of the strings in an array and return that info back to us in an object. For example: ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"] would get us: Object { Codeup: 6, San: 3, Antonio: 7, Dallas: 6, Marco: 5, Cohort: 6, ES6: 3 }

    // other things you can do for reduce "total number of sales" "flatten an array"

    let stringArr = ["Codeup", "San Antonio", "Dallas", "Marco Cohort", "ES6"];

    let strLengthObj = stringArr.reduce(function(objectProp, element){
        objectProp[element] = element.length; //assign the length as a value of the property named element {elementName: elementLength}
        return objectProp;
    }, {})

    console.log(strLengthObj);


    //TODO Together: That's pretty wild, eh! Wonder what else we could get up to with .reduce() - how about we make a function and use .reduce() inside of it? We'll write a function named countWords that takes a sentence in a single string. We need to split that sentence into an array and then write a .reduce() that would let us know how many times each word appeared in the string.

    function countWords(sentence) {
        let words = sentence.split(' '); // transform a sentence into an array of words

        words = words.filter(function(word){
            return word !==",";
        })


        const wordCountObject = words.reduce((wordCounts, word) => {
            if (typeof wordCounts[word] === 'undefined') {
                // if the word is not yet present in our object, set it's value to 1
                wordCounts[word] = 1;
            } else {
                // otherwise increment the existing count
                wordCounts[word] += 1;
            }
            return wordCounts;
        }, {}); // start with an empty object
        return wordCountObject;
    }

    let sentence = 'Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb';
    // {Mary: 1, had: 1, a: 1, little: 3, lamb: 3}

    console.log(sentence);

    console.log(countWords("this is working"+ sentence));


    //TODO Together: Pretty good, but do we want to count the number of times the comma is involved? If only we had a method that would .filter() - wait! Let's refactor the above function to do just that!



    //TODO: Let's make a new array of objects to use - make an array of objects [{},{},{}] consisting of a number of family members as objects with their name and ages as properties. Use .reduce() to sum up the age of those family members and see what it is! e.g. [{name: "Thurston Howell III", age: 50}, {name: "William Dean Howells", age: 83}] would be 133 by adding those two age properties together (50 + 83).

    var familymembers = [{
        name: "debbie jane richmond sanders",
        age: 60
    },{
        name: "timothy craig lefkowitz",
        age:32
    },{
        name: "bulbasaur",
        age: 5
    }
    ]

    // let sumage = familymembers.reduce(function(total, age){
    //     return total + age.age;},
    //     0);


    let sumage = familymembers.reduce(function (total, familyMember){
        return total + familyMember.age;
    }, 0)
